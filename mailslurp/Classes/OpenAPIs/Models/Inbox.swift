/** Representation of a MailSlurp inbox. An inbox has an ID and a real email address. Emails can be sent to or from this email address. Inboxes are either &#x60;SMTP&#x60; or &#x60;HTTP&#x60; mailboxes. The default, &#x60;HTTP&#x60; inboxes, use AWS SES to process emails and are best suited as test email accounts. &#x60;SMTP&#x60; inboxes use a custom mail server at &#x60;mx.mailslurp.com&#x60; and can only receive emails - they  are best used for public facing email addresses. Use the &#x60;EmailController&#x60; or the &#x60;InboxController&#x60; methods to send and receive emails and attachments. Inboxes may have a description, name, and tags for display purposes. You can also favourite an inbox for easier searching. Inboxes can be private or allow team access. Team access enabled inboxes can be seen by other members of an organization.  */
