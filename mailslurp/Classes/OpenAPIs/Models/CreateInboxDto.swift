/** Options for creating an inbox. An inbox has a real email address that can send and receive emails. Inboxes can be permanent or expire at a given time. Inboxes are either &#x60;SMTP&#x60; or &#x60;HTTP&#x60; mailboxes. &#x60;SMTP&#x60; inboxes are processed by a mail server running at &#x60;mx.mailslurp.com&#x60; while &#x60;HTTP&#x60; inboxes are processed by AWS SES. Inboxes can use a custom email address (by verifying your own domain) or a randomly assigned email ending in either &#x60;mailslurp.com&#x60; or (if &#x60;useDomainPool&#x60; is enabled) ending in a similar domain such as &#x60;mailslurp.xyz&#x60; (selected at random).  */

If you use the &#x60;useDomainPool&#x60; option when the email address is null it will generate an email address with a more varied domain ending such as &#x60;123@mailslurp.info&#x60; or &#x60;123@mailslurp.biz&#x60;. When a custom email address is provided the address is split into a domain and the domain is queried against your user. If you have created the domain in the MailSlurp dashboard and verified it you can use any email address that ends with the domain. Note domain types must match the inbox type - so &#x60;SMTP&#x60; inboxes will only work with &#x60;SMTP&#x60; type domains.

To retrieve the email use the Inbox and Email Controller endpoints with the inbox ID. */

When domain pool is enabled an email address will be generated ending in &#x60;@mailslurp.{world,info,xyz,...}&#x60; .
