/** Options for creating an inbox. An inbox has a real email address that can send and receive emails. Inboxes can be permanent or expire at a given time. Inboxes are either &#x60;SMTP&#x60; or &#x60;HTTP&#x60; mailboxes. Use &#x60;SMTP&#x60; for public facing mailboxes and &#x60;HTTP&#x60; for test email accounts. &#x60;SMTP&#x60; inboxes are processed by a mail server running at &#x60;mx.mailslurp.com&#x60; while &#x60;HTTP&#x60; inboxes are processed by AWS SES. Inboxes can use a custom email address (by verifying your own domain) or a randomly assigned email ending in either &#x60;mailslurp.com&#x60; or (if &#x60;useDomainPool&#x60; is enabled) ending in a similar domain such as &#x60;mailslurp.xyz&#x60; (selected at random).  */
