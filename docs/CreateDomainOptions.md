**createdCatchAllInbox** | **Bool** | Whether to create a catch all inbox for the domain.

You can access emails using the regular methods on this inbox ID. | [optional] 
**_description** | **String** | Optional description of the domain. | [optional] 
**domain** | **String** | The top level domain you wish to use with MailSlurp. Do not specify subdomain just the top level. So &#x60;test.com&#x60; covers all subdomains such as &#x60;mail.test.com&#x60;. Don&#39;t include a protocol such as &#x60;http://&#x60;. Once added you must complete the verification steps by adding the returned records to your domain. | [optional] 
**domainType** | **String** | Domain type to create. HTTP or SMTP domain. HTTP domain uses MailSlurps SES MX records. SMTP uses a custom SMTP server MX record.
